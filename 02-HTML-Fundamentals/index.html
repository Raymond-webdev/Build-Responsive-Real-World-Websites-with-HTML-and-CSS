        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS
            and
            JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
        <p>
            In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
            <strong>L</strong>anguage.
            It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
            programming language).
        </p>
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images,
            video,
            etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <!-- The <ol> tag defines an ordered list.-->
        <ol>
            <!--The <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list-->
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
            <li>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can learn more at
            <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.-->
                <!-- The "target" attribute allows the url to be opened in a new tab-->
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/html" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
        </p>

        <h3> Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>

        <!--The <ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.-->
        <ul>
            <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
            <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
            <li>To build web applications</li>
            <li>To impress friends</li>
            <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
