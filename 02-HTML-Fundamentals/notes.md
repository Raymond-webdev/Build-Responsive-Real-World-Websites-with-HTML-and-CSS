# HTML fundamentals

The first part of the course "HTML Fundamentals" covers a series elements in order to build your HTML page.
#### For example: 

1. The HTML document structure
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>My first HTML document</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
   </body>
</html>
```

2. Text elements 
```
- <h1?></h1> to <h6></h6>
- <p></p>
- <strong></strong>
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>
```
3. Images and attributes
```
<img src="" title="" alt=""/>
```
4. Hyperlinks
```
<a href="" alt="" title="">Hyperlinks</a>
```
5. Structuring our page inside containers like 
```
<nav> or <div>
```
6. Semantic HTML means that certain elements have a meaning or a purpose attached to them.
#### For example
```
-A <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.
By using HTML tags like <nav>, <header> <article>, <footer> that have meaning, you create pages that impart more information than those that simply surround everything with <div> tags. 
```
