# The 3 ways of building layouts with CSS

1. The first technique is using **Float Layouts**.
- This is the old way of building layouts of all sizes using the float CSS property.

2. The second technique is using **Flexbox**.
- This is the modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimenstional row without using floats.
- Perfect for component layouts.

3. The third technique is **CSS Grid**.
- With CSS Grid we can actually build complete 2-dimenstional layout which is perfect for big page layouts and also more complex components.
