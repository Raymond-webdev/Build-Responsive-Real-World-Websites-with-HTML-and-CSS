# Justify-content

- The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).

## Positional alignment 

- justify-content: center;     /* Pack items around the center */
- justify-content: start;      /* Pack items from the start */
- justify-content: end;        /* Pack items from the end */
- justify-content: flex-start; /* Pack flex items from the start */
- justify-content: flex-end;   /* Pack flex items from the end */
- justify-content: left;       /* Pack items from the left */
- justify-content: right;      /* Pack items from the right */
- justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute items evenly
                                   The first item is flush with the start,
                                   the last is flush with the end */
- justify-content: space-around;  /* Distribute items evenly
                                   Items have a half-size space
                                   on either end */
- justify-content: space-evenly;  /* Distribute items evenly
                                   Items have equal space around them */
- justify-content: stretch;       /* Distribute items evenly
                                   Stretch 'auto'-sized items to fit
                                   the container */
