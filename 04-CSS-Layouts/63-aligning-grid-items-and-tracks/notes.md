### Just like in flexbox, in CSS grid we also have got the ability of aligning grid items.
### We can align tracks inside the container with the "justify-content" and "align-content".

### Examples:
```
 justify-content: center;
 align-content: center;
```

### we can also align items inside cells(moving items around the cells).
### Examples:
``` 
justify-items: center;
align-items: center;
```
