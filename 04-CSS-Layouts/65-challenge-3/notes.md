### In the 3rd challenge I had to create the same layout and design for the converse shoes website but instead of using flexbox I had to use the flexCSS Grid property.
### I have had to apply the "display: grid;" property to the main container then adjust the smaller containers inside it byt applying:
```
 "grid-template-columns:" and "grid-template-rows:" prperty to the container aswell as the gap property.
 ```
