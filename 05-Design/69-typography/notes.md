## Typography
- Is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language **legible**, **readable** and **appealing**  when displayed.

## SERIF VS SANS-SERIF

### Serif typefaces:
- Creates a traditional/classic look and feel
- Conveys trustworthiness 
- Good for long text

### Sans-Serif Typefaces
- Modern look and feel
- Clean and simple
- **Easier to choose for beginner designer**

1. ### Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe.
2. ### It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3. ### Choose the right typeface according to your website personality:
  - Choose the right personality for your website
  - Decide between a serif and a sans-serif typeface
  - Experiment with all the "good" typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts) to see which ones best     fits your website's message.
  - You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page.

### Examples of SANS-SERIF typefaces:
- Inter
- Open Sans
- Roboto
- Montserrat
- Work Sans
- Lato

### Examples of SERIF typefaces:
- Merriweather
- Aleo
- Playfair Display
- Cormorant
- Cardo
- Lora

### Use good Font sizes and weights
1. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range.
2. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text.
3. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.
4. For **headlines**. you can go really big(50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality.
5. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular).

### Create a good **reading experience**
1. Use less than 75 characters per line.
2. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
  - The smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be!
3. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural ( this will come from experience).
4. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.
5. Usually, don't justify text
6. Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
