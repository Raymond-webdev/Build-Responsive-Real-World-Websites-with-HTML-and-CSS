## Implementing Typography
- Below I have implemented a few typograpfy styles in order to give the project website a clean and modern look.
- I have applied a SANS-SERIF typeface called "Inter" for the whole text.
-  Font-size has been applied for the text throughout the page in order to increase/decrease the size of the text.
- The line-height has also been applied in order to increase/decrease the space between the text lines.
- The letter-spacing has been applied in order to increase/decrease the space between letters.


```
body {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  font-size: 44px;
  line-height: 1.1;
  letter-spacing: -1px;
}
```
