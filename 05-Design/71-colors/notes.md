### Choose the right color

1. Make sure the main color **match your website's personality:** colors convey meaning!
- **Red** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement.
- **Orange** is less aggresive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
- **Yellow** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
- **Greens** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
- **Blue** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
- **Purple** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
- *Pink** represents romance, care, and affection
- **Brown** is associated with nature, durability and comfort
- **Black** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. Use a **good color tone!** Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.

3. You need a least two types of colors in your **color palete:** a **main color** and a **grey color**.

4. With more experience, you can add more colors: **accent (secondary) colors** (use a tool)

5. For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" **(tints and shades)**.

6. Use your main color to **draw attention** to the most important elements on the page.

7. Use colors to add **interesting accesnts** or make **entire components or sections** stand out.

8. You can try to use your color strategically in **images and illustrations**.

9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to **use a tint of the background** ("lighter version") for text.

10. Text should usually not be completely black. **Lighten if up** it looks heavy and uninviting.

11. **Don't make text too light!** Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors.
  -  Contrast ration needs to be at least **4.5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text** (18px).
