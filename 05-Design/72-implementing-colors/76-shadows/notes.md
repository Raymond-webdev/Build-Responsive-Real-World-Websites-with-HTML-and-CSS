## Shadows

01. You don’t have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality
02. Use shadows in small doses: don’t add shadows to every element!
03. Go light on shadows, don’t make them too dark!
04. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to drawattention)
05. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
06. Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface
07. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
08. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
