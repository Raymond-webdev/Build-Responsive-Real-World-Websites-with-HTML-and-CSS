## Icons

### Use **good icons**

1. Use a **good icon pack,** there are tons of **free** and paid icons packs.

2. Use only one icon pack. **Don't mix** icons from different icon packs.

3. Use **SVG icons** or **icon fonts.** Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!

4. Adjust to website personality! **Roundness, weight** and **filled/outlined** depend on typography.

### **When** to use icons

5. Use icons to **provide visual assistance** to text.

6. Use icons for **product feature blocks**.

7. Use icons **associtaed with actions,** and **label them** (unless no space or icon is %100 clear).

8. Use icons **as bullet points**.

### Use icons **well**

9. To keep icons neutral, **use same color as text.** To draw more attention, **use different color**.

10. Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and **fit the text or action!**

11. don't make icons larger than what they **were designed for**. If needed, **enclose them in a shape**.
