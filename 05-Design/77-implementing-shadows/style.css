/* Below it's a demonstration of how shadows work. */
/* In order to add a shadow, we need to use the box-shadow property. */

/* The box-shadow also requires multiple values 
    - the first value is the horizontal offset
    - the second value is the vertical offset
    - the third value is the blur of the shadow
    - the fourth value is optional and it's to do with the scaling the shadow up
    - the last value is the color
    */
