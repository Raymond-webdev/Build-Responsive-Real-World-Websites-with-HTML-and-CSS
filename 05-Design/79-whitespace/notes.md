 ### Whitespace
 
01. Use tons of whitespace between sections
02. Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
03. Use whitespace between elements
04. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines
05. The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be!
06. Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove whitespace from there
07. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need
more whitespace
08. Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
