## Below there is an example of how to analise and improve the visual hierarchy in the current design project by using white-space and some other techniques that I have learned in the previous lessons.
## One of the example in order for the important elements of the page to sand out is to implement a background color aswell as marging and making the font of the text bold and more distinguished.

.testimonial-section {
  background-color: #087f5b;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  font-size: 24px
  font-weight: bold;
}
