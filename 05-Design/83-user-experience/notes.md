## User Experience (UX)

01. Don’t design complicated layouts. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know
02. Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive
03. Use blue text and underlined text only for links!
04. Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 milliseconds
05. In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
06. Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. [web apps]
07. Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality) [web apps]
08. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don’t be vague or fancy!
09. Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear
10. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and “smart-sounding” words
11. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.
