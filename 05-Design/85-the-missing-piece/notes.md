## The missing piece: Steal like an Artist!

- In order to come up with great design and improve your webpage you need to analize other great designs and copy what you like, this is called **stealing like an artist.**

- When we want to come up with a great design we still need to care about all the things that's been talked about up to this point, so things like choosing a website personality and thinking about all the different design ingredients by using the guidelines and rules.

- So the missing piece is basically to get **inspired** and **stealing like an artist.**

- Stealing like an artist means that we don not completely copy a certain design so what we do instead is simply take the good parts of some other good designs and adapting them to our needs while using again all of the different rules and guidelines.

- Some of the websites where you can get inspired are:
