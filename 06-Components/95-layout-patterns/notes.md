## Hero section

### The hero section is basically the very first section of the page which contains like a discription of the site in the main headin and many times it also has some buttons and some images.
### Right now for the hero section there are three big trends:

- The first one is to have text one one side and the image on the other side.
- The second one is to have a background image with some text on top
- The third on is to first have some text and then below that, some image.

## Footer section

### We can do the page's footers in many different ways but right now it's quite common to include a complete site map of your website right here in the footer.
### If your website is very big with a lot of different pages then maybe it doesn't make sense to have like an entire site map but at least some secondary or even tertiary links are usually found in the footer.
### So some info about the company or some privacy policies or simply some other information of company or website.
### It's also very common to have the social icons in the footer so the links that will point to the different social media profiles of the company and sometimes there's also some kind of submit forms like to sign up for some newsletter or something like that.

##  Call-to-action section

### These are some kind of sections that we have close to the end of the page where after presenting all the information that you wanted to show on the page we then want the user to take some kind of action, maybe subscribing to newsletter or trying out a free trial or simply contacting the company.
### For these sections it's quite common to have them stand out from the rest of the elements of the page by using a some sort of visual hierarchy like using a different color or using some background image.
### When you build some kind of marketing page then usually you will want to have a call-to-acction section by the end of the page.

## Feature rows

### Feature rows are small sections of the page which usually describe some features of the product or service and usually multiple of theses rows are then combined using some kind of pattern.
### A feature row is usually quite simple so normally there is some kind of image on one side and then there is some text on the other side and the text is usually some small heading and some description and also sometimes maybe a button that leads to a page that explaines that feature a little better.


## Row of boxes/cards

### A layout pattern is simply a specific way of repeating a certain component multiple times and the most simple layout pattern is probably a simple row of boxes or row of cards.

## Z-pattern

### This one is a combination of different feature rows, so basically the Z-pattern is a way of repeating similar feature rows but with alternating configurations.

## F-pattern

### In here we have the F-pattern which can also be about repeating feature rows but the repetition can also be about something like more horizontal cards.
### The main difference between the F and the Z pattern is that the configuration of the rows does not alternate.

## Single column

### This one is mostly used on responsive websites on mobile phones or also on just very simple websites.
### Also this layout can be used on simple block posts where we don't want any side bars for distraction.

## Sidebar

### The side bar can be used for blocks or they can be used for options in a web application or as a table of contents or also as a summary.

## Multi-column/magazine

### This one is basically about combining different columns with different width into some kind of layout to create a more traditional magazine layout.

## Asymmetry/ Experimental

### We can use all ou creativity in order to create some standout designs.
### Many of these experimental layouts were actually made possible with CSS Grid.
