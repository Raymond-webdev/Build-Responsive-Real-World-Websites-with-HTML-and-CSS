1. Define
2. Plan
3. Sketch
4. Design and build
5. test and optimize
6. launch
7. maintain and update

1. ## Define the project

- Define **Who the website is for.** Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?
- Define **What the website is for.** In other words, define **business and user goals** of your website project.
- Define a **target audience.** Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this can come from your client).

2. ### Plan the project

- Plan and gather **website content:** copy (text), images, videos etc.
- Content is usually **provided by the client,** but you can also help them produce and find some content (simply finding free images is easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra).
- For bigger sites, plan out the **sitemap:** what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy).
- Based on the content, plan what **sections*8 each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order.
- define the **website personality**.

3. ## Sketch layout and components ideas

- Think about what **components** you need, and how you can use them in **layout patterns.**
- **Get ideas out of your head:** sketch them with **pen and paper** or with some design software (e.g. Figma).
- This is an **iterative process:** experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution.
- You don't need to sketc everything, and **don't make it perfect.** At some point, you're ready into HTML and CSS.

4. ## Design and build website

- Use decisions, content and sketches from Steps 1, 2 and 3 to **design and build the website with HTML and CSS** ("designing the browser").
- You already have the **layout** and **components** that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual **visual styles.**
- Create the design base on selected **website personality,** the **design guidelines** and **inspiration**.
- Use the **client's branding** (if it exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: **colors, typography, icons,** etc.

4. ## Test and optimize

- Make sure website works well in **all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Test the websiteon **actual mobile devices,** not just in DevTools.
- Optimize all **images,** in terms of dimensions and file size.
- Fix simple **accessibility** problems (e.g. color contrast issues).
- Run the **Lighthouse*8 performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues.
- Thins about **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO).

5. ## Launch the masterpiece

- Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client (or yourself), it's time to **share your masterpiece with the world!**
- Upload your website files to a **hosting platform.** There are countless platforms, a common one with a free plan is **Netlify.**
- Choose and buy a great **domain name,** one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write.

6. ## Maintain and keep updating the website

- Launch is not the end...
- Keep the website content **updated over time.** If you're working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract.
- Install **analytics software** (e.g. Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may **inform future changes** in the site structure and content.
- A **blog** that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users coming back, and is also good for SEO.
