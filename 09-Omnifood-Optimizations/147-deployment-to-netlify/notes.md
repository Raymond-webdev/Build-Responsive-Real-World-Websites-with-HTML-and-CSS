In this lecture I am going to show how to launch and deploy the website onto a live server on the inetrnet.
- One very nice free service website hosting provider is called Netlify and it can be accessed on netlify.com
- ALl you need to do is to sign up for the services, then click on the links that says "sites" and then all the way at the end you will find a field where you can drag and drop your site folder.
