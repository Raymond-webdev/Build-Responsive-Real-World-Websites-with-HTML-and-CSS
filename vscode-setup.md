# VS Code setup used in the course
I show how to set up VS Code with these themes, extensions and settings in the first section of the course, in lectures Setting Up Our Code Editor and Installing Additional VS Code Extensions. But for your convenience, here is a quick list of everything you need in order to set up VS Code to follow the course.

## Theme
I use the One Monokai in all the course videos. This is a free theme, similar to my personal favourite Monokai Pro. Link →

## Extensions
`Auto Close Tag` to automatically close HTML tags. Link →

`Auto Rename Tag` to automatically update matching HTML tags. Link →

`Color Highlight` to highlight colors in CSS code. Link →

`Image Preview` to display an image preview next to the code Link →

`Prettier` to automatically format code. Link →

`Live Server` to create a live preview for the current project. Link →

## Settings
`Auto Save` set to onFocusChange, to automatically save files

`Default Formatter` set to Prettier - Code formatter (esbnp.prettier-vscode), to enable the Prettier extension to format our code

`Format on Save` set to true, to have Prettier format our code each time we save it

`Word Wrap` set to on, to avoid vertical scrollbars for long content

Tab Size set to 2, for better code readability
